This repo contains a custom plugin for phoneGap which retrieves a listView 
containing an array of packageNames for tasks running in the background of the device.

I also have a plugin for killing (killBackgroundProcesses) a chosen package from the listView, but I'm hesitant to upload it.
The listView reserves some unstable packages from the array, but the plugin still might be
detrimental to some devices.

The code was created as part of a reseach document for a college project, but feel free
to edit, advance or just rip it.
